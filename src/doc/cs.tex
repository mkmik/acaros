\chapter{Coding Style}

\section{Module names}

Module names are lowercase.

Example: \texttt{hat}

\section{Function names}

Function names are prefixed with the module name
and are in ``smalltalk-style'': every word begins with
a capital letter except the first one.

Example: \texttt{module\_getSomething()}

\section{Type names}

Type names can be prefixed with the module name
if the type is private. If types are used by clients
but opaque module prefix is optional.

Every type must end with the suffix \texttt{\_t}.
Structure names (not typedefs) may not end with \texttt{\_t}.
Every structure declaration should have a corresponding typedef.
